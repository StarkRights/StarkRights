# Hi!
I'm Stark (or Chase)!


Some random things about me:
1. hates the idea of webdev
2. mostly writes in NodeJS/TypeScript
3. ultimately loves projects that just end up being webdev
4. hates electron 
5. doesn't get anything done because he refuses to use electron
    - (Tauri[?](https://tauri.app)) :eyes:
6. loves SublimeText
7. doesn't have a functioning pancreas
7. hates SublimeText
    - (Zed[?](https://zed.dev)) :eyes: Update 9/24: 'multiplayer' from the start is cool and probably useful i guess, but even if i was on mac or linux id still be using sublime. why can't anyone just make sublime but with a vscode sized community that actively uses it üò≠ 
8. [relevant](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1445/)
9. wishes apple would burn in a fire
10. owns an iphone & ipad (but ooooh no that's not enough money sir! no no no you committed the sin of not buying another entire computer in a walled ecosystem that doesnt have compat for tools/systems you already use/need, so you're not *allowed* to develop for the $2000+ worth of devices you own. *\*pthu\**)
    - ... i'm salty
    - Edit: i have become cringe; X-er of Code... i bought a used macbook. kill me.
    - Edit: somehow i became even fucking cringer- the used macbook was just too painfully slow so i bought a 2020 apple silicon mbp... im the problem

# Projects
At the moment, most of my time is spent on academics and life,:tm: but I try to keep up with what I can. 
## Stuff that gets worked on
- Phrase (name wip?) - an i(Pad)OS apple-pencil based notetaking app thats definitely gonna be way better than all of the other totally not-already-perfectly-usable handwritten note taking apps.
- Yet Another Multi System Mouse Plexer (YAMSIP) - a mouse without border 'clone' that will totally be way more gooder than mouse without borders.
- Stupid News for Stupid People - a sidebyside HN reader (ie, article + comments on same screen). This probably already exists, but i havent found it yet so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

## Stuff that like. Totally gets worked on.
  - NonfungibleBot - a silly djs bot based on the craptacularly silly concept of "owning" your friends dumb discord messages- AND voice clips!
  - Agendair  - a (theoretical) webapp / api / iOS shortcut suite which will (somewhat) facilitate editing notes from the [Agenda](https://agenda.community) app for i/iPad/macOS
  - PFIYA     - a minecraft bukkit plugin that turns parrots into immersive (no commands!) carrier pidgeons to ferry items between players.
  - DiaBotes  - a discord bot that hooks into & displays realtime CGM data from NightScout (official Dexcom apis have data delay. :sadge:)
