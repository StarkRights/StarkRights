10. owns an iphone & ipad (but ooooh no that's not enough money sir! no no no you committed the sin of not buying another entire computer in a walled ecosystem that doesnt have compat for things you like/need, so you're not *allowed* to develop for the $2000+ worth of devices you own. *\*pthu\**)

    - Edit: i bought a used macbook. i have become cringe, x-er of code. kill me.

# Projects
At the moment, most of my time is spent on academics and life,:tm: but I try to keep up with what I can. 
## Stuff that gets worked on
  - NonfungibleBot - a silly djs bot based on the craptacularly silly concept of "owning" your friends dumb discord messages- AND voice clips!
## Stuff that like. Totally gets worked on.
  - Agendair  - a (theoretical) webapp / api / iOS shortcut suite which will (somewhat) facilitate editing notes from the [Agenda](https://agenda.community) app for i/iPad/macOS
  - PFIYA     - a minecraft bukkit plugin that turns parrots into immersive (no commands!) carrier pidgeons to ferry items between players.
  - DiaBotes  - a discord bot that hooks into & displays realtime CGM data from NightScout (official Dexcom apis have data delay. :sadge:)
