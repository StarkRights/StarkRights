Hi, I'm stark (to most)!

- I do most of my development in NodeJS / TypeScript, but also write a fair bit in Java and C++. 
- I'm currently working on a couple of private projects between schoolwork and life stuff!
  - NonfungibleBot - a silly djs bot based on the craptacularly silly concept of "owning" your friends dumb discord messages- AND voice clips!
  - PFIYA - a minecraft bukkit plugin that turns parrots into immersive (no commands!) carrier pidgeons to ferry items between players
  - Agendair - a (theoretical) webapp / api / iOS shortcut suite which will (somewhat) facilitate editing notes from the [Agenda](https://agenda.community) app for i/iPad/macOS
- Unofficial sublime text snob
